# Scylla

This is the Ohio State Underwater Robotics new bboxing application, currently under development. Our planned completion date is likely somewhere late February, depending on how things go. 

# Installation 

Just clone the repo, then execute `bash setup.bash` in the `setup` directory. This will likely take 5-10 minutes. It does the following: 

- Builds and bundles the Python installation (3.6.10) that is used by the rest of the project
- Installs OpenLabeling's required Python modules (torch, etc.) and bundles them with the project
- Installs Electron and the other JS stuff we need 

# Gitbook Migration

I've written this README so that it can hopefully just be copy-pasted over to save some work for our incredibly hard-working documentation team.
